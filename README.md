wp2anchor
======

Imports Wordpress data into Anchor.

Takes a standard wordpress XML file, stores all of that data in arrays and then inserts into MySQL. Simple to use.

The information currently not used by Anchor (post tags and multiple categories) is stored as extended post meta data for future use.

Usage
=====

Simply save import.php to any location on your web server, and navigate to it. Then follow the instructions. It's that easy.

*	Site meta data
*	Categories list
